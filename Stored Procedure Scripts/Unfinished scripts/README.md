Not sure why the python script isn't finished. I think whatever I was going to write with it was just easier to script out in powershell but it sorta looks like I was doing the same thing. The perl script I thought would work well with regexs but it turns out I didn't need to do much pattern matching anyway. It was just easier to stick with python since I actually know that.
